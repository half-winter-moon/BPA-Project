                maintaining peaceful life, because it decreases the chances of drought, water shortages, and even political conflict.
                <br>
            By conserving water in our communities, not only will human life flourish, but wildlife and plant life as well. Everything depends on water to survive, so 
            why not take care of it? Another reason to be more water-conscious is the fact that saving water saves you money! Using less water at home saves you 
            more money on those annoying water bills  </p>
