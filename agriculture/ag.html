        <h2>Agriculture and Livestock Management</h2>
        <p>
          Manure is one of the culprits for Carbon emmissions in the
          Agriculture/Livestock industry. To reduce the amount of Carbon, we
          must change the way manure is stored.<br /><br />
          Does your stomach often feel weird when you eat certain foods?
          Interestingly enough, the foods given to livestock can have an effect
          on how much Carbon (in the form of Methane) they produce. If we focus
          on giving livestock food that causes them to produce less Methane,
          then we can decrease the Carbon footprint of this industry.

        <h2>Land Management</h2>
        <p>
          The way in which land is managed and maintained can have a significant
          impact on how much Carbon is emmitted and how much Carbon is removed
          from the air. Since 1990 The EPA records that Land-Use/Forestry
          efforts have removed more Carbon from the air than they have emmitted.
          What can be done to keep this going and increase the removal of
          Carbon? We need to continue to maintain and reforest land and
          deforested areas.
