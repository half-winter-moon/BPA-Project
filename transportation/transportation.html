          Burning fossil fuels such as gas and oil used for various sources of
          transportation releases greenhouse gases into the Earth's atmosphere.
          The larger a transportation device, the greater the harmful emissions.
          Thus, taking short or unnecessary flights is a quick way to make a big
          difference, and not in a good way.

        <p class="tip__par publicTransport">
          Choosing to take public transportation where available decreases an
          individual's carbon footprint, as the emission from the larger vehicle
          is averaged out by how many people are on it. There are not many public 
          transportation options available in our community, but there are shuttles that take 
          you to Walmart or the airport. Comparing the total
          emissions that each individual that could have taken a bus would
          accumulate from driving separately, it is clear that we can reduce our
          carbon footprint as we work together.

        <p class="tip__par bikes">
          Taking a road trip can create less emissions of greenhouse gases than
          an airplane flight would. Choosing to use public transportation can
          further reduce an individual's negative effect on the environment from
          modern transportation. One step further would be to walk or ride a
          bicycle on short distance trips that otherwise would have been driven.
          Cyclists do not add to the numerous greenhouse gases emitted by
          motorized transportation methods.

          Even small decisions like choosing to ride your bike or walk a block
          instead of driving there can make a positive difference in the world!
