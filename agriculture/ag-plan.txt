Agriculture Impact Plan:

Methane (CH4) Footprint:
"Domestic livestock such as cattle, swine, sheep, and goats produce CH4 as part of their normal digestive process."

The way in which animal manure is stored will produce more or less greenhouse gasses.

When these two are combined, agrictulture becomes the largest producer of CH4 in the United States.


Nitrous Oxide (N2O) Emssions:
Application of fertilizers
Manure Management
Burning of agrictultural residue

Carbon Dioxide (CO2):
Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry:
Since 1990 this Land-Use/Forestry has actually pulled more CO2 out of the air/atmosphere than it has emitted. This happens because 
plants consume CO2 to survive. In areas where deforestation or land degradation occurs, there will be more CO2 in the air/atmosphere.
